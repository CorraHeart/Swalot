-Dash attack is meant to be a slow, possibly armored move that is rather meaty and can possibly kill with the sweetspot (when he initially hits the ground)
-Forward Air has a bit of windup, but it's got a good few active frames and is likely a kill move at high-ish percents. Ideally combos out of dtilt?

[Etc]
-Increase volume of sound effects.
